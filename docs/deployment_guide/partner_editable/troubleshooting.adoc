== Best practices for using Consul on AWS

The following best practices are enabled by default for this Partner Solution:

* Enable Consul ACLs for token-based authentication. This lets users use a token to authenticate and
access the Consul control plane and APIs. For more information, see
https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/access-control-setup-production[Secure Consul with Access Control Lists (ACLs)^].

* Enable Gossip encryption. Gossip encryption helps to ensure that the ACL authentication between the server and client agents (RPC) are protected from sniffing. For more information, see
https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/gossip-encryption-secure?in=consul/security-networking#gossip-encryption[Secure Gossip Communication with Encryption^].

* Enable Agent TLS encryption. Consul uses TLS to verify the authenticity of servers and clients. For more information, see https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/tls-encryption-secure?in=consul/security-networking[Secure Consul Agent Communication with TLS Encryption^].

* Enable SSL certificates on Consul agents. This helps to protect the Consul agent communication from attacks. For more information, see https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/tls-encryption-openssl-secure?in=consul/day-2-agent-authentication[Secure Consul Agent Communication with TLS Encryption and OpenSSL Certificates^].

* Enable Connect Inject and the gRPC protocol. This enables the Envoy proxy on the client pods. For more information, see https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/service-mesh-with-envoy-proxy#enable-connect-and-grpc[Secure Service Communication with Consul Service Mesh and Envoy^].

== Security
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating
// data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed
// information.

* End-to-end TLS is enforced.
* A dedicated Kubernetes namespace is created for {partner-product-name} Kubernetes resources.
* {partner-product-name} runs on dedicated Kubernetes nodes.
* The {partner-product-short-name} UI is provided for exploratory purposes. We recommend keeping the
{partner-product-short-name} UI accessible only inside the VPC or disabling access to it by setting the
permitted IP range to 127.0.0.1/32.

== Other useful information
//Provide any other information of interest to users, especially focusing on areas where AWS or cloud usage differs
//from on-premises usage.
