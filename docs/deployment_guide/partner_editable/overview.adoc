This guide covers the information you need to deploy the {partner-product-name} Partner Solution in the AWS Cloud.

HashiCorp Consul is a product that helps to centrally secure, store, and control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys through its user interface (UI), command line interface (CLI), or HTTP application programming interface (API).

Use cases for HashiCorp Consul include:

* Service registry and health monitoring to provide a real-time directory of all services and their health status.
* Network middleware automation with service discovery for dynamic reconfiguration as services scale up, down, or move.
* Zero-trust network with service mesh to secure service-to-service traffic with identity-based security policies and encrypted traffic with mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS).

This Partner Solution is for service-networking professionals and application developers who want to securely connect, monitor, and automate services. Itâ€™s deployed via the Consul Helm chart, which contains all of the resource definitions to install and configure Consul inside of a Kubernetes cluster.
